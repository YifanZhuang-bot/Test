Hi, my name is Yifan, and I'm based in Biel, Switzerland. Since 2022, I've been working as a Project Manager at GF Machining Solutions. I have a background in mechanical engineering, with a specialization in automation. While I don't have experience in data analytics or data science yet, I do have some skills in Python and am excited to expand my knowledge in these areas.
